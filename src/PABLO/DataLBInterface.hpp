    \brief Base class for data communications
    
    This class is the base class used to implement the user interface
    to data communications for load balance.
    
    The Curiously Recurrent Template Pattern is exploited to achieve the interface.
    By this way the interface is based on static polymorphism with no extra cost at runtime.
    
    The user has to implement his communication classes for load balance
    by deriving them from this class.
    The mechanism implies that the derived class derives from a template base class
    and that the template parameter is the derived class itself, as follow
    @code
    class Derived : public Base<Derived>{...}
    @endcode
    The user has to implement all the methods of the base class in his derived class.
    These user's methods will really do the job.
    
    An example of user derived class can be found,[here](https://github.com/optimad/PABLO/blob/master/test/User_Data_LB.hpp),in test folder for the case of a double datum for each grid element.
    
    Easily speaking, only the user knows his data and through the interface specialization
    he states the size of element data, how to write/read and move them
    in a communication buffer.
